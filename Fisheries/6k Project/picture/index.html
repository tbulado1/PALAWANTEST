            <h4>Bachelor of Physical Education</h4>
            <p>
                To produce scientifically inclined physical education graduates who are imbued 
                with values and whose knowledge and skills will respond to the national and 
                global demands. Moreover, it will prepare and train qualified students to teach

            The College of Teacher Education is committed to maintain its status as the Center
            of Excellence in Teacher Education in MIMAROPA. Currently, the College has three (3)
            curricular programs, namely: the Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED); the Bachelor
            of Elementary Education (BEED); and the Bachelor of Physical Education (BPED).
            </p>
            <p>
            Since January 2023, the BSED program is ACCREDITED Level 4 while the BEED program had
            already compiled all requirements and is waiting for results. Hopefully, the BEED
            program can be granted Level 4 status this month. Today, we have the honor to submit
            the BPED program for this preliminary survey visit.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Bachelor of Physical Education (BPED) is a newly implemented program at the College,
            designed to produce graduates who are not only physically educated but also advocates of
            health and wellness. Even with challenges brought by the pandemic and extreme weather,
            the College continued to offer the best learning experiences through blended learning
            modalities that allow our students to adapt and succeed. Thus, we were able to harvest
            the first cohort of graduates in July 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
            The faculty, led by the Chairperson and the Dean of the College of Teacher Education,
            ensured that students receive the quality education they deserve, resulting in a higher
            passing rate for first-time LET takers since March 2023. The Department of Physical
            Education has also forged partnerships with local and international institutions through
            research, conferences, and training.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our team has diligently prepared for this visit, ensuring all documents and evidence are
            in place to demonstrate our commitment to providing quality education. On behalf of the
            entire faculty and staff, I welcome you to CTE – the home of innovators!

            Welcome to the Hub of Future Fitness and Wellness Advocates, and Physical Education Teachers!
            </p>
            <p>
            On behalf of the College of Teacher Education's Department of Physical Education,
            we are excited to welcome you to the Bachelor of Physical Education Preliminary Survey Visit.
            </p>
            <p>
            Five years ago, the BPED program was introduced as a new pathway for students aspiring
            to become PE teachers. In 2022, the program earned a Certificate of Compliance from
            the Commission on Higher Education, affirming adherence to the rigorous standards of
            Palawan State University.
            </p>
            <p>
            This year, we are seeking a preliminary survey visit as the initial step toward formal
            accreditation. We believe this will validate our commitment to quality and enhance
            students’ educational experience.
            </p>
            <p>
            We are eager to share the achievements and innovations our team has worked on.
            We are committed to transparency and open dialogue and look forward to productive
            discussions that will contribute to the continuous enhancement of our program.
